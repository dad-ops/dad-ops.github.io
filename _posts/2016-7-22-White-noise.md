title: White noise to calm baby

[White noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise) is a noise which contains all frequencies at the same time. It can be described as a sound of rain or a radio that is not tuned to a channel. White noise calms babies as it reminds them of the sounds of the womb.

It is practical to have a portable and easy to use method to produce white noise as needed. One option is to buy a portable radio, and have it not tuned to a channel. If needed you can also find devices which have a rechargeable battery and an MP3 playing capability of from a USB storage device. [They are not even that expensive.](http://www.ebay.com/itm/201581824246)
